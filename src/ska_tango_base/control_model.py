    that belongs to a subarray is unresponsive, or may report healthState as ``FAILED``.

    Difference between ``DEGRADED`` and ``FAILED`` health shall be clearly identified
    (quantified) and documented. For example, the difference between ``DEGRADED`` and ``FAILED``

    Higher-level entities shall intelligently exclude ``NOT_FITTED`` items from ``healthState`` and
    Element Alerts/Telescope Alarms; e.g. if a receiver band in DSH is ``NOT_FITTED`` and there
